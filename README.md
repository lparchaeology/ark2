# About ARK

ARK (The Archaeological Recording Kit) is a web-based ‘toolkit’ for the collection, storage and dissemination of archaeological data.  It includes data-editing, data-creation, data-viewing and data-sharing tools, all of which are delivered using a web-based front-end.

It is designed to be adaptable to any digital or paper-based recording system, so does not dictate what or how the archaeologist records at a given site. Rather it provides a framework, an interface and a set of pre-fabricated digital tools for archaeological recording and data dissemination according to the unique needs of any given project.

Based on industry standard data technologies (Apache/MySQL/PHP), ARK is completely opensource and standards-compliant.

Development of ARK is led and supported by L - P : Archaeology (http://www.lparchaeology.com/).
